Making Data Visible, Actionable & Executive-Ready

I specialize in transforming fragmented and complex data into structured, decision-ready intelligence for leadership teams. My work focuses on designing scalable Business Intelligence solutions that go beyond reporting-building governed data products that support clarity, accountability, and measurable business outcomes.

With over 5 years of experience and international onsite exposure across healthcare, finance, and academic sectors, I have delivered analytics solutions that align operational performance with strategic objectives. I help organizations move from static dashboards to insight-driven decision systems.

🎯 What I Deliver

Executive-ready Power BI dashboards designed for leadership conversations

Structured semantic data models using advanced DAX

KPI frameworks with weighted performance scoring

Forecasting and trend analysis for proactive planning

🧠 My Approach

Start with Business Questions – Define what decisions need to be supported.

Design Strong Foundations – Clean data models, reliable KPIs, governed metrics.

Build for Executives – Clarity, signal over noise, and storytelling flow.

Ensure Adoption – Scalable systems with documentation and training support.

If insights are not trusted or actionable, they do not create value.
